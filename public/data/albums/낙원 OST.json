        "Oh Danny boy\nthe pipes the pipes are calling\nFrom glen to glen\nand down the mountain side\nThe summer's gone\nand all the flowers dying\n'Tis you 'tis you\nmust go and I must bye\n\nBut come he back\nwhen summer's in the meadow\nOr when the valley's hushed and white\nwith snow\nTis I'll be here in sunshine\nor in shadow\nOh Danny boy oh Danny boy\nI love you so\n\nBut when he come\nand all the roses falling\nAnd I am dead as dead\nI well may be\nGo out he find\nthe place where I am lying\nAnd kneel and say\nan Ave there for me\n\nAnd I will hear\nthe soft you tread above me\nAnd then my grave will warmer\nsweeter be\nFor you shall bend\nand tell me that you love me\nAnd I shall sleep in peace\nuntil you come to me"
